# NLP Meta-GPT Style Transfer

Welcome to the NLP Meta-GPT Style Transfer project! This project leverages the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) approach to train a GPT-2 model, enabling it to perform few-shot learning for any style transfer task, including styles not seen during the training phase. Utilizing the StylePTB dataset, our model showcases the flexibility and power of adapting to new styles with minimal examples.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to advance the capabilities of language models in understanding and generating text across a diverse range of writing styles. By integrating MAML with GPT-2, we enable our model to quickly adapt to new styles, ranging from formal to casual tones, or even mimicking specific authors, with only a few examples.

## Features

- **Few-shot Learning**: Our model can learn to transfer styles with just a few examples, making it highly efficient and adaptable.
- **Versatility**: Capable of handling a wide range of styles, even those not encountered during training.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to be easily integrated into existing NLP pipelines and applications.
